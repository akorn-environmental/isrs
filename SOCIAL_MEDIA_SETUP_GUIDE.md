#### About Section (2,000 character limit)

```
The International Shellfish Restoration Society (ISRS) unites scientists, practitioners, and communities worldwide to protect and restore vital shellfish ecosystems that are critical to ocean health and coastal resilience.

🌊 OUR MISSION
Building community and advancing innovation in global shellfish restoration through science, education, and collaborative action.

🦪 WHY SHELLFISH MATTER
Molluscan shellfish ecosystems provide some of nature's most powerful solutions to our most pressing challenges:
• A single oyster filters 50 gallons of water daily
• Shellfish reefs protect coastlines from storm surge and sea level rise
• These ecosystems support biodiversity and sequester carbon
• They sustain coastal communities worldwide

Yet we've lost up to 85% of them globally. ISRS exists to reverse this trend.

🌍 WHAT WE DO
• Host the International Conference on Shellfish Restoration (ICSR) - the world's premier gathering for molluscan shellfish restoration since 1996
• Connect 2,600+ members across six continents
• Foster collaboration among research institutions, government agencies, conservation organizations, Indigenous communities, industry partners, and local stakeholders
• Advance scientific understanding and scale successful restoration approaches worldwide

📍 ICSR2026: October 4-8, 2026
Little Creek Casino Resort, Shelton, Washington
Hosted by Puget Sound Restoration Fund
Theme: "Engaging Communities, Collaborating with Knowledge Holders, and Advancing Restorative Aquaculture"
