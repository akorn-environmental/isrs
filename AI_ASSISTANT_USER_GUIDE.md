## ⚙️ Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
❌ **Too Vague**: "Show me stuff"
✅ **Better**: "Show me contacts from universities in California"

### Ask One Thing at a Time
❌ **Too Complex**: "Show me all contacts and funding and emails and board members"
✅ **Better**: "How many contacts do we have?" (then ask follow-ups)

### Use Natural Language
✅ You can ask questions just like you'd ask a person:
- "When is the conference?"
- "How many people registered?"
- "Who's on the board?"

### Start a New Query
- After getting a response, click **"New Query"** to ask another question
- This clears the previous response and shows example questions again
